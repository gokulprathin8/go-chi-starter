# Golang Chi Starter Template

A simple and lightweight starter template for building web applications using the [Chi router](https://github.com/go-chi/chi), [GORM](https://gorm.io/), and [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/). This template provides the basic structure and tools needed to quickly get up and running with Go for building RESTful APIs or web apps.

- Graceful shutdown for the server.
